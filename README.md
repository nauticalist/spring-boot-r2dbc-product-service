# Reactive Spring Boot with R2DBC

Source code for my "Reactive Spring Boot with R2DBC" inhouse course. 
Topics covered in my course: 

- Using R2DBC with Reactive Data Repository
- Using mapstruct for mapping on the communication layer (By communication layer I mean, controller and broker packages)
- Event publishing and serwing events with WebSocket


This is my own implementation. If you have any questions or recommendations, feel free to contact me @linkedin
